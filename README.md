# wiCon-Appfi
 An app that holds intenet data from home router, what if YOU could download an app that could hold some internet data from your home's router (is not stealing) this your home's router. Not sure if "DATA" is the proper name for this, instead of using public wifi where some jerk might be able to hack your device, You could use "DATA" from your own router that is stored in an app that app is able to save 5Gb, 10Gb or up to 30Gb of "DATA".
