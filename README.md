 I have a great idea for an app, if you read my previous app idea about your router can save a certain amount of data in the app it self?... I started to think a little outside the box and something happen to me which no one thought it was possible I have become a victum of my router being hacked I did a little investigation on my city and I found out some of my neighbors were also victums. I started to thinking maybe I could get some contibutors to help me on this app.
 
 1) Build a app
 2) Obviously we need to know the internet companies.
 3) The main point of this app is to prevent routers from being hacked what I found out this could 
    be done with DDOS or DOS acttacks if not familiar with this kinds of attacks heres a link    
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack but there could be other ways of attacks as well.
